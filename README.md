# cs_go
## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive

mostly taken from this tutorial:

https://cs.ingame.de/counter-strike-global-offensive/tipps-tricks/grenade-trajectory/

save both files in:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

run both scripts in the console with:

exec xyz  
xyz is the filename without .cfg

run in this order (because nades_server restarts the server and you lose the items at this moment):

exec nades_server
exec nades_util
